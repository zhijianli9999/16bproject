    "#### *Predicting water shortages in California's Central Valley using periodic water level data*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "California's Central Valley produces 1/4 of the nation's food and its supplies 1/5 of national groundwater demand.[^1] However, the region is prone to drought and water shortages. Furthermore, predicting these water shortages is difficult. Climate change has thrown off the statistical models resulting in huge errors in official water supply predictions, including a 68% error in the predictions for the Sacramento Valley region this year.[^2] Perhaps in response to the poor performance of these complex hydrological models, the California Department of Water Resources recently released its [Drought and Water Shortage Risk Explorer](https://tableau.cnra.ca.gov/t/DWR_IntegratedDataAnalysisBranch/views/SmallWaterSystemRisk-March2021/Dashboard?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y), containing an interactive map of the shortage risks of wells in the state. However, this risk assessment does not incorporate past data into a statistical model. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the [Household Water Supply Shortage Reporting System](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/household-water-supply-shortage-reporting-system-data), which logs 3765 reports of water shortages in California from 2014 onwards. We combine this with a dataset of all wells in the state. The predictors used are the [periodic groundwater level measurements](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/periodic-groundwater-level-measurements) from the Department of Water Resources.\n",

    "For the model to be useful for making predictions ahead of time, we need to exploit the time dimension of our data. Now, instead of averaging out the measurements across time, we aggregate the measurements (which are sporadically taken at roughly one-month intervals) into monthly data, interpolate missing months with the earlier value, and take the first difference. We also include the first and second lag (measurements from two prior months) to augment our predictors. After running the model, we obtain predicted values for every month-coordinate combination in the dataset. The average across time of the predicted values are mapped below, but the set of predictions contain a lot more information. Looking at the regression summary, both the water level measurement and its first lag are statistically significant. In fact, the first lag of the water level measurement is statistically significant regardless of whether the measurement for the month itself is included, suggesting that the water level changes may predict shortages before they occur.

    "In conclusion, this exercise has demonstrated that periodic groundwater level measurements contain useful signals for well shortages. In particular, this prediction task calls for incorporating both spatial and temporal lags. To extend the work of this project, future efforts could improve the method of geographical aggregation, take into account climate (especially seasonality), and include more detailed information on local hydrology such as the proximity to water features. As a concrete recommendation, the relevant authorities would do well to improve data availability and linkage, and to judiciously incorporate hydrological data into their existing risk-prediction systems."
