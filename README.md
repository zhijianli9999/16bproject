## Project Dry Wells

The final project report can be found [on my course blog](https://zhijianli9999.github.io/project/).

The `code` folder contains:
- `visualize.ipynb`, which is the notebook on which the blog post (project report) is based.
- `clean.py`, which cleans the data in the `data` folder and outputs them to the `cleaned` folder.
- `predict.py`, which runs the prediction models.

The `data` folder contains the raw data files on wells, shortage reports, and station measurements downloaded from the internet.

The `cleaned` folder contains cleaned datasets for the model.

The `output` folder contains the visualizations in HTML files.
