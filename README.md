The `code` folder contains:
- `clean.py`, which cleans the data in the `data` folder
- `predict.py`, which runs the prediction models
- `visualize.ipynb`, which includes the results and serves as the project report

The `cleaned` and `data` folders contain data.

The `output` folder contains the visualizations in HTML files which I need to include in the blog post.
